# how to build a r_e_c_u_r - diy enclosure

disclaimer - this is a cheap and diy approach to getting a r_e_c_u_r video sampler in your hands. if you like the device and think its worth some $$ for more professional hardware (mechanical keys, aluminum panels etc) hmu, i can add you the `boutique enclosure` wishlist.

## get some parts

for using other parts and other questions check out the [faq] , or get in touch.

these are the parts you need to get. to reduce shipping costs to nz i sourced them through aliexpress.com but you could equally get them from ebay or elsewhere.

### main parts:

- [raspberry pi3] *37 USD*

- [raspberry pi screen] *12 USD*

- [usb keypad (AliExpress)] or [usb keypad (Amazon)]  *9 USD*

![main parts][main parts]

### optional c_a_p_t_u_r addons:

- [raspberry pi camera] *7 USD*
- or [piCaptureSd1] *149 USD*
  
![capture parts][capture parts]

(note piCaptureSd1 is better supported in v2beta)

### other bits and pieces:

- 4x m2 and 6x m3 screws, 6mm is long enough - i ended up using 4 2-gauge and 6 4-gauge self tapping screws instead which were easier to get into the plastic case.

- 4 gb or greater mircoSD card

- a stable 5volt, 1A microUsb power supply

- some rubber feet for the bottom ? i had [these rubber feet] around from a previous project that work nicely

## print some things

- i 3d printed my enclosure using these files for the [top] and [bottom]. if you dont have access to a printer you can upload these files to a popular printing service in you region (eg ...)

- _note on enclosure: you could also just buy a standard raspberry pi3 (+screen) case and use the numpad externally. i personally found the 3d printing took a bit too long so am working on a lasercut-able option too. watch this space_

- 2d print these [key stickers] if you want to use the default key mapping, or modify the svg file (in inkscape or something) to create your own. you could print them onto vinyl, label paper or just normal paper and attach with with double sided tape...

## put it together

- using [etcher] (or otherwise) flash the micro sd with my [modified image] of raspbian (or follow these [instructions to install] from scratch.)

- _quick note about versions: i have uploaded a new modified image which you can read about and find [here]. this fixes some old bugs and adds some new features (and maybe some new bugs) this will replace the above image soon_

- insert sd card into pi

- use the 4 small screws to attach pi+screen to the bottom piece of enclosure

- attach the lcd screen via the pi header pins so it fits exactly on top of the pi. (some little spacers could be used to support the top corners of the screen)

- put a battery in the keypad , insert its usb dongle into the pi. fasten the keypad to the baseplate; i used some double sided tap along raised strips - although now im thinking superglue might hold better...

- use the 6 large screws to hold the top panel to the bottom

you are done ! wasnt that easy ?
