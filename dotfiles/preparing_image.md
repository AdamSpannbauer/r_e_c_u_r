# documenting the exact steps to creating the r_e_c_u_r raspbian image

- downloaded the latest (2017-11-29 ~~2018-04-18~~) raspbian-raspbian-lite image from offical site.

- flashed it to my sd using etcher

- set up auto console login and changed keyboard layout using `sudo raspi-config`

- following the beginning of [this](https://gist.github.com/kmpm/8e535a12a45a32f6d36cf26c7c6cef51) guide,
set up wifi and run all updates: 

`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` Add the bottom of the file
```
network={
  ssid="YOUR_SSID"
  psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
}
```

then `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` , sudo reboot

- i trieds to get this working without needing pixel installed (using openbox and a few other bits but the drivers for my screens didnt work like this - decided its not worth shaving that yak rn. will procede with a stripped pixel as described above:
 
 - download/install pixel + all the extra things needed for r_e_c_u_r : 
 ```
 sudo apt-get install -y raspberrypi-ui-mods git python3-tk ttf-mscorefonts-installer omxplayer libdbus-glib-1-dev python3-pip unclutter python3-picamera gpac 
 
 pip3 install dbus-python omxplayer-wrapper  mido python-rtmidi
 ```

- now can set up auto desktop login using `sudo raspi-config`

- pull down recur code into home dir ~ : `git clone https://github.com/langolierz/r_e_c_u_r.git`

- used `sudo nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart` to add these lines : 
```
@unclutter -display :0 -idle 0 -root -noevents
@xset s off
@xset s noblank
@xset -dpms
@bash /home/pi/r_e_c_u_r/dotfiles/launcher.sh
```

and remove the line `@point-rpi` 

(im not sure exactly what each part does and if it works but is suppose to stop screensaver / hide cursor / remove on screen power warnings etc)

- i then went into pi item -> Preferences and set a black background , small task bar , no screensaver  and went into the file explorer -> Edit -> Preferences -> Volume Managment -> unchecked 'show available options for removable media ...' 

and made taskbar auto hide...

creating internal storage folder in ~/Videos

splash screen : can set a custom splash screen by setting an image at `/usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix/splash.png` , i made a copy of the original : `sudo cp /usr/share/plymouth/theme/pix/splash-old.png` and then copied my own from a flash stick...

## running lcd-driver files...

## making the config.txt and driver file writable so python can edit it

i need to update the config.txt to change various video settings etc. at first i was running bash scripts from within python to do this. i think it is better for all the logic to be done from inside the code, although my program does not have the permission needed to update these files. instead of giving the program root access , i want to just make the files it needs to edit writable.

`sudo chmod 777 /boot/config.txt` and `sudo chmod 777 /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbturbo.conf` i know this is kinda bad , but need some way of doing it ?

## flashing

first remove my wifi connection !

i am trying to flash the device using the unix command `dd` on a raspberry pi.

- i want my image to not contain empty space so it can fit on smaller sd cards (4gigs)

- first check how much space is needed and name of device : `df -h`

- ~~do i need to mount the device : ??~~

couldnt figure out how to not take entire card (including empty space) , so decided to try entire 4gg card, to a usb and then try compressing in down :

- `dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/FLASH DRIVE/recur.img`
- `gzip -k recur.img` (to keep original)

going to copy and zip in one (with larger byte size) :

`sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/mmcblk0 | gzip > /media/pi/FLASH DRIVE/r_e_c_u_r.img.gz`

## removing empty space on pi image

i had another go at this and might have had some success using [pishrink], following the instructions on readme exactly , i managed to reduce a 3.8gg image down to 2.9gg and then zipped down to 1.15gg (no saving here) , this would be more useful with larger cards though.

- the flow is using dd to copy the image from the pi to an external drive `dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/pi/FLASH DRIVE/recur.img`

- then use pishrink to reduce this image `sudo pishrink.sh recur.img`

- then gzip to zip this : `sudo gzip recur.img`
